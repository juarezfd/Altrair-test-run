# Altrair-test-run
A repository with a Juypyter notebook showing the use of the Altair Data Viz library with a dataset initially from Kaggle. The dataset was cleaned and prepared it for analysis matching Hadley Wickam's tidy data concept. Future goal is to use an anime database API (e.g., AniList, Jikan, MyAnimeList, etc.) as the data source.
